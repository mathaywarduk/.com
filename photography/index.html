                    <h2>Jack Pe&ntilde;ate</h2>
                    <p>Having a friend who works in events for Nottingham Trent University is sometimes useful. When I fancied doing some gig photography his arm was easily twisted. This shot was a happy accident, a test shot when the settings weren&rsquo;t quite right, meant that the movement is captured with the outlines of 4 or 5 faces.</p>

                    <p>I was lucky enough to be asked by Kelly &amp; Jonny to photograph their wedding in Tuscany. This shot is taken at the Italian residence where the main ceremony and reception took place, with amazing views over the hills.</p>

                    <p>In 2010  on a break in &#344;evnice, a small town just outside Prague, we took a trip to Karl&#353;tejn Castle, where the flags of the Czech Republic and the European Union fly together.</p>

                    <p>After a 3 day wedding where I took over 1500 photographs, I thought I&rsquo;d take a break from being behind the lens. That was until I saw the sun popping out from behind this imposing structure.</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;ve seen Elephants both in the wild and in captivity. In the wild it&rsquo;s an awe-inspiring experience, at a Safari Park, it only feels sad.</p>

                    <h2>Street view</h2>
                    <p>This shot was an experiment. Taken directly on the pavement, I think the shallow depth of field makes it.</p>

                    <p>I was invited to the dress rehearsal of Oliver! at Stoke&rsquo;s Regent Theatre. This shot of the character Mr Brownlow, is one of my favourites due to the amount of negative space.</p>

                    <p>San Gimignano is a medieval walled town in Italy which has fourteen towers of varying heights. This was the view from the top of the tallest one, Torre Grosso. It was a scary climb.</p>
