The definition of spam is an unsolicited electronic message. (That and canned meat of dubious origins).

Based on the first example, if you try to offer me a job on LinkedIn despite my profile stating that I'm not interested in hearing from recruitment salespeople, I'm going to mark it as spam.

While I'll do this with all unsolicited crap that I get, LinkedIn is by far the 'spammiest' platform I've been on. And it's no accident. It's built that way on purpose.

LinkedIn allows people business (desperate) enough to upgrade to a Pro account the ability to find and, more importantly, message anyone. Not just the people in their network. Not just the users who have already connected with you. Everyone.

This makes LinkedIn popular with that lowest type of salesperson... the lazy recruitment agent.
