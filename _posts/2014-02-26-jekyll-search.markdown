You may or may not know that this site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. That means there's no database, so page load speed is much faster.

Without a database though, there's nothing to query when needed, i.e. when wanting a [search function](/search), so I went about building a work around.

With the [Liquid templating](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) language, used by Jekyll, I built a [JSON encoded feed](/feeds/feed.json) for posts and pages on the site which I wanted to show up in search results.

{% raw %}
<pre><code>[
    {
        "title": "{{ post.title }}",
        "content": "{{ post.content | markdownify | strip_html }}",
        "link": "{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}",
        "date": "{{ post.date }}",
        "excerpt": "{{ post.snippet }}"
    }
    ...
]</code></pre>
{% endraw %}

I then wrote a Javascript plugin which receives a search term, either from a querystring or a form submission, and looks for the term within the JSON feed.

With this data, it's pretty simple to output the results directly into the DOM using a template partial.

    <img src="/static/images/blog/jekyll-search.png" alt="Jekyll search" class="media__item">
</figure>

That's it explained in it's simplest form anyway. Try it out for yourself over on the [search page](/search) and let me know what you think.

If you're interested in exactly how I've gone about this, you're in luck. It's definitely not perfect yet, but, regardless, I have released the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/mathaywarduk/jekyll-search) so other Jekyll users can use it, alter it, even improve on it.

There are a few things things I'd like to fix/tidy up in the future, like:

* The JSON feed isn't very 'pretty' - I know this isn't important, but I'm all for well-formed markup.

* Date formatting would be nice. - I've done this on this site myself by tweaking the Javascript file, but it's not ideal to force people to use my date formatting, so it's not in the repo. 

* Make the script into a jQuery plugin - This would make it possible to customise your search function without having to change the plugin itself.

## Update

Thanks to [this pull request](https://github.com/mathaywarduk/jekyll-search/commit/7c48400dc9b633c56fe2f2900c1b548bf368d3d0) from [Marcel van der Boom](https://github.com/mrvdb) I now escape JSON using the ruby 'json' gem.

To do this, Marcel added a plugin which registers a filter:

<pre><code>require 'json'

module JsonFilter
  def json(input)
    input.to_json
  end

  Liquid::Template.register_filter self
end</code></pre>

After that, he uses that filter to escape the JSON, removing the need for quotes in the Liquid template and ensuring special characters don't cause any errors.

        "date": {{ post.date | json }},
        "excerpt": {{ post.snippet | json }}
