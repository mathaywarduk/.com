Recently, we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of articles and tweets from digital agencies proclaiming &ldquo;Mobilegeddon&rdquo; is coming on 21st April (argh, that&rsquo;s tomorrow!). And, coincidentally, all you have to do to avoid the apocalypse is commission them to build a responsive website.

The truth is that nobody really knows this to be a fact. While [Google has made an announcement](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/finding-more-mobile-friendly-search.html), the exact nature of its search algorithms have always been a closely guarded secret.

## So, what <u>do</u> we know?

### Mobile-friendliness is already a ranking factor

In 2013, Google started to use whether a website was properly configured for use on smartphones as a ranking factor, while last year they started to promote websites that had been developed for multiple devices (AKA [Responsive Web Design](http://madebykind.com/services/responsive-web-design/)).

### These changes will only affect searches from mobile devices

As Google are always working to deliver the most relevant results for any given user&rsquo;s current context, they not only take into account the keywords entered, but also the device being used and it&rsquo;s location.

### It&rsquo;s not imperative to have a responsive website.

While a responsive website will usually show up as &ldquo;Mobile-Friendly&rdquo; in search results, so will a stand-alone mobile website. For instance, theTrainline.com uses separate mobile and desktop sites, which is shown will depend on the type of device requesting the site. This passes Google&rsquo;s Mobile Friendly test [as you can see from the result](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=thetrainline.com).

## What can you do?

Ok, so that may have alleviated some of you qualms, but even if you already have a responsive or stand-alone mobile site, that may not be enough.

### Your website needs to be properly configured

Google provides information on [selecting your mobile configuration](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/overview/select-config?hl=en) based on the way you serve mobile vs desktop experiences. Getting this wrong will result in your website being marked as not mobile-friendly, even if it is.

### Responsive design isn&rsquo;t just about adapting to device width

Some responsive sites will fail the Mobile-Friendly test, as they only respond to reductions in screen width by stacking content. Failure could come from not considering readability and usability. If you&rsquo;re not sure, run your site through Google&rsquo;s [Mobile-Friendly test](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/) and see if it passes.

### Speed is set to become a factor too

When Responsive Web Design is executed well it leads to a quick and usable experience for all, but too often, less experienced developers will create a site that&rsquo;s much slower than it could (and should) be.

While it&rsquo;s not part of the latest update to the algorithm, page speed is an important factor for users, with most expecting a mobile site to load with 3â€‘5 seconds.

Google have recently been experimenting with [the slow label](http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2015/02/25/google-new-slow-label-web-performance/). Similar to the Mobile-Friendly label, it shows users when a site takes a long time to load, and if history is any indicator could soon be part of the ranking algorithm. You might therefore want to take a look at Google&rsquo;s [Page Speed rules](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rules) and see how your site measures up using [Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).

## But, do you need to do anything?

If you&rsquo;re unsure about how this change is going to affect you, then you probably don&rsquo;t know your users well enough. Rather than churning out a rushed solution to a problem that&rsquo;s not fully understood, it would be more beneficial to start with some research.

* What percentage of your website&rsquo;s visitors use mobile devices?
* What are the conversion rates on mobile and desktop?
* What percentage of your incoming traffic comes from Google?

Once we know these things, we can find a solution to fits your site and your business perfectly. And even if that solution is what you originally envisaged, you&rsquo;ll have a better understanding of why, and be able to make more informed decisions in the future.
