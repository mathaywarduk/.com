A while back I started working on a pretty nice, but simple, [interactive HTML5 video](http://behindthescenes.tribeuk.co.uk/go).

The desire was to promote the [art direction](http://www.tribeuk.co.uk/portfolio) service offered by the company I worked for at the time, [Tribe](http://www.tribeuk.co.uk), via well-produced video content.

Although it was all but finished when I left the company a month later, it&rsquo;s taken a while to get the final tweaks done as is always the case with internal projects, especially with the attention to detail Tribe are known for.

Now it&rsquo;s alive and kicking on the internet I'm pleased to see it getting some attention over social media. [The video alone is excellently put together](http://www.chrisjpavey.co.uk), but the interactive element just adds that something more.

You can [take a look behind the scenes](http://behindthescenes.tribeuk.co.uk/go) on the Tribe website.
