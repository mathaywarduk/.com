Itâ€™s been about 18 months since [net magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine) published my article outlining the basic premise of [creating a modular living framework using Sass and BEM](/modular-css-with-sass-and-bem/) and, as with so much in this industry, the working practice has improved substantially since then.

So I thought it might be helpful to share how we&rsquo;re currently handling modular development at [Kind](http://madebykind.com/), what challenges we come across daily and ideas we have for improving our methods in the future.
